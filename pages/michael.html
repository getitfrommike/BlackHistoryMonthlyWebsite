    <p>Mr. Butler wrote that the holy city called Jerusalem in the Bible was surrounded by mountains. The city was built in high mountains.</p>

    <p>That fact had been overlooked — or ignored — for over 500 years. Jerusalem is a key city to all three of the world’s major religions.</p>

    <p>Mr. Butler wrote that Jerusalem was a Black city. Built by Black people. He claimed it was in the high mountains of Peru, South America. Sites like Machu Picchu and Sacsayhuamán match biblical measurements down to the cubit.</p>

    <p>He even went to a museum in Europe to locate an ancient measuring tool to prove it.</p>

    <p><strong>This is a HUGE accomplishment for Black history.</strong></p>

    <p>Mr. Butler has sacrificed his time and wealth to recover the lost, hidden, stolen, and gatekept ancient Black history of the Americas — including <strong>Biblical</strong> Black history.</p>

    <p>He writes in <em>When Rocks Cry Out</em> that many Black preachers and scholars lack the courage to tell the truth about these discoveries.</p>
