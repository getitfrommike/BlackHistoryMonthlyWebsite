      <h3>Who We Are</h3>
      <p><strong>Black History Montly...</strong> First and foremost, we are <strong>BLACK</strong> people..</p>
      <p>The term/word, Black, MUST now be defined, as it has avoided an accurate and proper definition due to lack of correct representation. Not saying that Black people have not given a definition to Black before. I am saying for the past 500 years, the TRUE identity and history of Black people has been so hidden, distorted, obscured, misunderstood and confounded that the appropriate definition must be assigned. Based on a collection of recent, groundbreaking discoveries.<p>The absence of color or complete absorption of light. So, Black is not a color...in Physics. But, Black is a color in art and design. These are some of the things that have been associated with Black. It appears that there is some type of SECRET to Black. <p> BUT...we are NOT talking about the ideas of the depth of the light spectrum or an artists' color wheel. We are talking about BLACK...as in Black people. The definition of Black is going to need to be studied. The appearance of Black may not be on the color spectrum up to certain nanometers. However, there is measure beyond the visible color spectrum that is just as, or more  important, but never talked about when discussing Black...or, Black people. <p>The importance of Black in our defintion is the relationship that Black has with the sun. Outside of a visible color/light, the sun has a Black light that is called ULTRAVIOLET. This is a part of the light that powers human beings. Black human beings. <p></p>UV light is the Black light that acts with the Earth. The Sun emits radiation: gamma rays, X-rays, UV, IR, and radio. These are all BLACK lights outside of the visible light spectrum. <p> <br>We live in a SOLAR SYSTEM.</p><p>Black skin color is the best skin color for human beings in a solar system. We realize that UV (ultraviolet) sun rays interact with the natural composition of Black skin with a natural affinity, and believe that more research and study must be dedicated to further the understanding on a biochemical and scientific level.</p></section>

          <!-- Who we are -->
    <section id="who-we-are" class="section">
      <h3>Who We Are (CON'T)</h3>
      <p><strong>Black People NAMED these TWO LANDS, America, over 22,000 years ago.</strong> Black people have <strong>ALWAYS</strong> been in the Americas.</p>
      <p>America is a Black BLOODLINE and a Black BIRTHRIGHT. So called white people are NOT Americans. <p>There is a lot of work that needs to be done for restoring and re-establishing the correct understanding and status of Black people in the United States of America and the world. There are many Black people who believe that Africa has a monopoly on who is a Black person and who is not. Africa is NOT the authority on who and/or what Black people are. For that matter, the so-called white people of Europe and the U.S. are not the autority on who/what Black people are.  <p> The error was created intentially with the U.S. Census, Naturalisation  and various codes in the 1700s,  during the time of SCIENTIFIC RACISM. Black people were classified and categorized by inferior so-called white men during the "Time of Enlightenment" into psuedo-scientific social constructs called RACE. <p></p>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS RACE!</p><p>As we begin to research the docuemented WRITTEN records of Ancient, Medieval, Early Modern and other historic eras,  Black people can use the written records to clarify the truth. <p>Black people named these TWO LANDS, America, over 22,000 years ago. Black people have ALWAYS been in the Americas.</p></section>

    <section id="who-we-are" class="section">
      <h3>Black People and People of Color</h3>
      <p>Black People are Black people BECAUSE of their SKIN COLOR. Hence, the NAME..."Black people."
      <p>There are ONLY two people on the Earth. Black people and non-Black people. This used to be a very well known and understood concept. But, over the years, it has been confused. The phrasing and terminology has changed. The term used to be WHITE and NON-WHITE. <p>Our goal is clarity and understanding.</p> <p>We are in a world that was previously establshed based on the fraud called SCIENTIFIC RACISM. Not too many people have taken the time to really research this subject. Black History MonthLY has dedicated an entire section of this project to that topic. Scientific Racism is the reason why DARK BLACK skin people have been separated from other dark Black skin people and classified as not being Black. If your SKIN is Black...you ARE a Black person.<p> Scientific Racism is the policy that created the idea that Black people ONLY come from Africa.  <p> It is from the policy of Scientific Racism that inferior so-called white men created, classified, categorized and named various sections  of the human family - constructed fake rules  in which make these human less human or more human, and designed stolen histories and identities to support their mask of inferiority...called Racism. This practice was promoted for so long that it almost seems to exist in perpetual motion. The fraud called SCIENTIFIC RACISM is now rooted in all levels of society: Family, Government/Political, Academia, Economy, Education, Religion, Media, ect.</p>It is because of Scientific Racism that the world has so many problems.  But, these are ONLY problems for the people who Scientific Racism was created to affect. Scientific Racism is not a problem to those who benefit from it. This is the END of Racism. Racism is the MASK of the inferiority of so-called white people and their children. <p><p>ONLY Black people can END Racism. So, this website/project is not for the purpose of supporting Racism. This is the END of Racism. Our goal is to study Scientific Racism and continue to destroy it. <p>The system of Scientific Racism  was created to benefit so-called white people. Within that system, there are benefits for non so-called whites who support racism and the fraud of the Scientific Racism doctrine. This is demonstrated in mupltiple subtle and overt ways. It is mostly displayed by people who have not studied and take the institutionalized Scientific Racism as a fundamental and foundational truth, rather than the fraud and pseudo-science that is has been proven to be.</section>
